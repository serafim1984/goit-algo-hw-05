# Search algoritms results

In all cases *Boer-Moor* algoritm gives the best result, *kmp* gives middle speed result and *rabin-karp* algoritm is the slowlest one. 

Boer-Moor algoritm works better due to shift strategy - which comply with theory.

KMP also gives good liniar time complexity however in this case slower than Boer-Moor

Rabin-Karp algoritm appears the slowest likely due to collisions in hash table which needed to be resolved.
